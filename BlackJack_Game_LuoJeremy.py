#Note to Viewer: The "deal_cards function" is used at the beginning of the game to deal two cards each to the player and the dealer. One of the dealer's cards is hidden, and the other is shown to the player.
#The "calculate_total" function takes a list of cards as input and returns the total value of those cards. If the list includes an ace, which can be worth 1 or 11, the function uses the value that results in the highest total without exceeding 21.
#The "display_results" function is called after the player has decided to stay and the dealer has taken all necessary cards. The function calculates the total values for both the player and the dealer, and then prints a message indicating the winner (or a tie).
#The main game loop repeatedly asks the player to hit or stay until the player either reaches 21 points or goes bust. Once the player decides to stay, the dealer automatically takes more cards until their total is 17 or more. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins. Otherwise, the display_results function is called to determine the winner. The game ends once the winner is determined.
